# Personal Site with React js

Welcome to my first react app. I decided to start with a simple single page application in the form of a personal site.

It will be deployed at paulinang.com

You can run it on your own machine with `npm start`

## Next Steps

I'm mostly unsatisfied with the layout/ design of my current site, but I also wanted to at least deploy a starting point and then take some time to explore better designs.

Depending on how much content I want to add, ex. more art pictures, other hobbies and projects, etc., I might look into a convenient way to regularly update and deploy this site.
